## Overview
This project presents a **Planetary Gear Mechanism** designed as a 3D mechanical model.  
Planetary gear systems are widely used in robotics, automotive transmissions, and mechanical applications due to their compact size, high torque density, and efficient power distribution.

## Description
The planetary gear system consists of:
- **Sun Gear** (center gear)
- **Planet Gears** (multiple gears rotating around the sun gear)
- **Ring Gear** (outer internal gear)
- **Carrier** (holds the planet gears in position)

This design demonstrates how rotational motion is transferred and reduced through the interaction of these components.

## Features
- Compact and efficient gear system
- Suitable for robotics and mechanical projects
- Designed for simulation and visualization
- Can be adapted for 3D printing or CAD analysis

## Software Used
- CAD design tool (e.g. Blender / Onshape)
- Suitable for mechanical simulation and animation

## Applications
- Robotics gearboxes
- Mechanical transmissions
- Educational demonstrations
- Prototyping and 3D printing projects

## Notes
- This model is intended for learning and demonstration purposes.
- Gear dimensions and tolerances may need adjustment for real-world manufacturing.
